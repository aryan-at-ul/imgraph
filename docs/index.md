## üìö Quick Start

### Basic Graph Creation

```python
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from imgraph import GraphPresets

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('sample_image.jpg')
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Create a graph using a preset
graph_builder = GraphPresets.slic_mean_color()
graph = graph_builder(image)

# Visualize the graph
fig = graph_builder.visualize_graph(image, graph)
plt.show()

# Access graph properties
print(f"Number of nodes: {graph.num_nodes}")
print(f"Number of edges: {graph.edge_index.shape[1]}")
print(f"Node feature dimensions: {graph.x.shape[1]}")
```

### Creating Custom Graphs

```python
from imgraph import GraphBuilder
from imgraph.data.node_creation import slic_superpixel_nodes
from imgraph.data.node_features import mean_std_color_features
from imgraph.data.edge_creation import region_adjacency_edges
from imgraph.data.edge_features import color_difference

# Create a custom graph builder
graph_builder = GraphBuilder(
    node_creation_method=lambda img: slic_superpixel_nodes(img, n_segments=100, compactness=10),
    node_feature_method=lambda img, nodes: mean_std_color_features(img, nodes, color_space='hsv'),
    edge_creation_method=lambda nodes, img: region_adjacency_edges(nodes, connectivity=2),
    edge_feature_method=lambda img, nodes, edges: color_difference(img, nodes, edges)
)

# Process an image
graph = graph_builder(image)
```

### Using the Pipeline API

```python
from imgraph import GraphPipeline

# Define a custom configuration
config = {
    'node_creation': {
        'method': 'slic_superpixel_nodes',
        'params': {
            'n_segments': 100,
            'compactness': 10,
            'sigma': 1.0
        }
    },
    'node_features': {
        'method': 'mean_std_color_features',
        'params': {
            'color_space': 'hsv',
            'normalize': True
        }
    },
    'edge_creation': {
        'method': 'region_adjacency_edges',
        'params': {
            'connectivity': 2
        }
    },
    'edge_features': {
        'method': 'color_difference',
        'params': {
            'color_space': 'hsv',
            'normalize': True
        }
    }
}

# Create the custom graph
pipeline = GraphPipeline(config)
graph = pipeline.process(image)
```

### Training a GNN Model

```python
import torch
from torch_geometric.loader import DataLoader
from imgraph.datasets import ImageFolderGraphDataset
from imgraph.models import GCN
from imgraph.training import Trainer, EarlyStopping

# Create dataset from a folder of images
dataset = ImageFolderGraphDataset(
    root='dataset_directory',
    preset='slic_mean_color',
    force_reload=False
)

# Split dataset
train_dataset, test_dataset = dataset.get_train_test_split(train_ratio=0.8)

# Create data loaders
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=4)

# Create model
num_features = train_dataset[0].x.shape[1]
num_classes = len(dataset.classes)
model = GCN(num_features, 64, num_classes, num_layers=3)

# Setup training
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(patience=10)

# Train the model
trainer = Trainer(model, optimizer, criterion, device, early_stopping)
history = trainer.fit(train_loader, test_loader, epochs=50)

# Evaluate
accuracy = trainer.evaluate(test_loader)
print(f"Test accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

### Combining Multiple Feature Types

```python
from imgraph import GraphBuilder
from imgraph.data.node_creation import slic_superpixel_nodes
from imgraph.data.node_features import mean_color_features, normalized_position_features
from imgraph.data.edge_creation import region_adjacency_edges

# Combine multiple feature extraction methods
def combined_node_features(image, node_info):
    return combine_features(
        [
            lambda img, nodes: mean_color_features(img, nodes, color_space='rgb'),
            lambda img, nodes: normalized_position_features(img, nodes)
        ],
        image, 
        node_info

graph_builder = GraphBuilder(
    node_creation_method=slic_superpixel_nodes,
    node_feature_method=combined_node_features,
    edge_creation_method=region_adjacency_edges

# Process an image
graph = graph_builder(image)
```

# Create multiple graph builders with different configurations
multi_builder = MultiGraphBuilder([
    GraphPresets.slic_mean_color(),
    GraphPresets.patches_color(),
    GraphPresets.superpixel_comprehensive()

# Process an image to get multiple graph representations
